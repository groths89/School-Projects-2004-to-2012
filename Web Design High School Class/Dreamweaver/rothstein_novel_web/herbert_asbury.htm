              <p><font size="+2">Asbury was a disenchanted Southern Methodist
                  from Missouri. He rebelled early against his strait-laced upbringing,
                  characterized its bigotry and hypoocrisy in his first book,
                  and threw himself into the lore of urban crime, gangsterism,
                  prostitution and gambling as a popular historian. He had served
                  in World War I, where he was gassed, permanently weakening
                  his lungs.</font></p>
              <p><font size="+2">Asbury achieved first notoriety with a story
                  that H.L. Mencken published in his magazine, The American Mercury
                  in 1926. The story detailed a prostitute from Asbury's hometown
                  of Farmington, Missouri. The prostitute took her Protestant
                  customers to the Catholic cemetery to conduct business, and
                  took her Catholic customers to the Protestant cemetery; some
                  in Farmington considered the prostitute beyond redemption.</font></p>
              <p><font size="+2">The article caused a sensation: The Boston Watch
                  and Ward Society had the magazine banned. Mencken then journeyed
                  to Boston, sold a copy of his magazine on Boston Commons, and
                  was arrested. Sales of the recently-founded Mercury boomed,
                  and Asbury was a celebrity. Asbury then focused his attention
                  of a series of articles debunking temperence crusader Carrie
                  Nation.</font></p>
              <p><font size="+2">Many of Asbury's works, mostly chronicling the
                  largely hidden history of the seamier side of American popular
                  culture, have been reissued.</font></p>

              <p><font size="+2" face="Playbill, Rockwell">Herbert Asbury was a top newspaperman and author of books chronicling
                  sin, crime, and religious hypocrisy. Many of his books dealt
                  with the darker, seamier side of American life over a time span
                  from the late 18th century to the early 20th century. THE GANGS
                  OF NEW YORK, GEM OF THE PRAIRIE and the BARBARY COAST portrayed
                  cities controlled by gangsters during most of the 1800's and
                early 1900's.</font></p>
              <p><font size="+2" face="Playbill, Rockwell">THE GANGS OF NEW YORK book was used as the basis for the movie,
                  GANGS OF NEW YORK, starring Daniel Day-Lewis and Leonardo DiCaprio
                  and directed by Martin Scorsese. GANGS was filmed in Rome and
                premiered on December 20, 2002.</font></p>
              <p><font size="+2" face="Playbill, Rockwell">Herbert was born in Farmington, Missouri, on September 1, 1889.
                  He was educated in the public schools of Farmington and attended
                  Carleton College. His ancestral background was very religious
                  and included several generations of devout Methodist Preachers.
                  Herbert's childhood was dominated by religion and he was fed
                  heavy doses of it constantly. At the age of fourteen, he left
                  the church and devoted himself to pleasures considered sinful
                  by the pious folk of Farmington. He learned to smoke cigarettes
                  (with the help of his older brother Emmett), play cards, swear,
                  openly ogle girls and drink whenever he could find a willing
                  bartender. Herbert's siblings, Mary, Emmett, and Fred eventually
                became disenchanted with the Southern Methodist Church.</font></p>
              <p><font size="+2" face="Playbill, Rockwell">His background greatly
                  influenced both his philosophy of life and his career of reporter
                  and author. The creation of
                  his first
                  two books UP FROM METHODISM and THE METHODIST SAINT arose from
                  his confrontations with his religious ancestry. Herbert first
                  became famous when he sold an article called HATRACK in 1926
                  to the late H. L. Mencken's American Mercury magazine. It was
                  the story of a Farmington prostitute who took her Protestant
                  customers to the Roman Catholic cemetery and vice versa. Hatrack
                  (standing with her arms outstretched she resembled a hatrack)
                  wanted to lead a better life and tried going to the local Methodist
                  church to receive religion. However, no one tried to convert
                  her and they ignored her because she was beyond redemption.
                  Hatrack was a &quot;Scarlet Woman&quot; and since there was
                  no forgiveness, she stayed in her profession as the town Harlot.*
                  The Watch and
                  Ward Society of Boston had the Mercury magazine banned from
                  sale in Boston because of the HATRACK article. H. L. Mencken
                  challenged
                  this action, went to Boston, and sold a copy of the magazine
                  on the commons. He was arrested, causing sales of the Mercury
                  magazine to boom and creating celebrities of both Herbert and
                Mencken.</font></p>
              <p><font size="+2" face="Playbill, Rockwell">Herbert worked as a reporter for various newspapers until 1928,
                  among the most memorable were the Atlanta Georgian, the New York
                  Sun, the New York Herald, and the New York Tribune. From 1928
                  on he devoted himself to the writing of books, magazine articles
                  and scenarios for motion pictures. He also wrote several Broadway
                  plays but they were not successful. Most of his books were written
                  in a documentary style dealing mainly with sin and crime. Herbert
                  wrote several fiction novels such as THE DEVIL OF PEI-LING and
                THE TICK OF THE CLOCK.</font></p>
              <p><font size="+2" face="Playbill, Rockwell">When World War I broke out, Herbert enlisted as a private in
                  the U.S. Army. He was rapidly promoted to Sergeant and then to
                  Second Lieutenant of Infantry. He served in France and was wounded
                  and gassed. The damage to his lungs caused Herbert health problems
                  throughout his life. He was honorably discharged from the service
                on January, 1919.</font></p>
              <p><font size="+2" face="Playbill, Rockwell">Herbert was married
                  twice and neither marriage produced any children. Herbert had
                  two residences: a house in Canada Lake,
                  New York and an apartment in New York City. On February 24,
                1963, at age 73, Herbert died from his chronic lung problems. </font></p>

              <font face="Playbill, Rockwell">
<p><font size="+2">In 1750 Thomas Asbury joined the masses of immigrants leaving England and
    other European countries in search of new frontiers to practice their religious
    or secular beliefs or for other reasons. Thomas came over here for other reasons,
    he had gotten into some kind of trouble in England and had been disowned by
    his father. His mother had died and Joseph, his father, had remarried and had
    a new son, Francis, who later would become the first Methodist Bishop in America.
    Thomas never met his step-brother but ironically, his future son, Daniel, would
    cross paths with Francis many years later.</font></p>
<p><font size="+2">Thomas Asbury married Susan Jennings and they settled in Fairfax County, Virginia.
    When the Revolutionary War broke out in 1776, their two oldest sons joined
    the fight against the British. John Asbury was killed at Brandywine and George
    Asbury was taken prisoner but survived the Revolution. Daniel, the youngest
    son, helped carry wagonloads of provisions to the soldiers on the front. On
    one of these trips, Daniel, age fifteen, was captured by the Shawnee Indians.</font></p>
<p><font size="+2">Daniel was adopted by an old Indian Chief and his squaw and
    he learned to speak their language. After about a year of living with the
    tribe, Daniel
  planned his escape. While the Indians were distracted hunting wild game, Daniel
  took
    off into the forest and made his way to the river. He crossed the river in
    a bark canoe that he had previously hidden by the river's edge. Unfortunately,
    a tribe of hostile Indians was waiting on the other side. During a confrontation
    with them, Daniel received a scalp wound but later recovered. The tribe was &quot;friendly&quot; towards
    the Tories and eventually sold Daniel to the British who imprisoned him for
    the duration of the Revolutionary war.</font></p>
<p><font size="+2">After more than six years absence, Daniel returns home and
    at first is not recognized by his family who assumed he had been killed by
    the Indians. Daniel
    makes himself known as their long lost son and recounts his harrowing adventures
    of the past years. Apparently, while Daniel was absent from his family, Methodist
    preachers had worked their &quot;magic&quot; on Thomas Asbury and converted
    him from a skeptic into a believer of the Methodist doctrines. Daniel also
    converted to Christ and united with the Methodists, believing that God had
    spared his life.</font></p>
<p><font size="+2">Daniel Asbury married Nancy Morris in 1790 and settled in Lincoln County,
    North Carolina. Daniel was an early pillar of Methodism and founded a Methodist
    church in Lincoln County in 1791. He was a devout and tireless preacher, ultimately
    becoming a Presiding Elder. Daniel Asbury followed in the footsteps of his
    religious relative, Francis Asbury, who was the first Methodist bishop in America.</font></p>
<p><font size="+2">Daniel and Nancy Morris Asbury had twelve children over a span of 24 years.
    The children had a very religious upbringing and several of them became ministers.
    One of the youngest, William Morris Asbury (born in 1810), became a local Methodist
    preacher. William married his second cousin, Susan Lester Marks, in 1835. They
    moved to Mississippi and settled among the Chickasaw Indians in Tippah County,
    now called Benton County.</font></p>
<p><font size="+2">William AsburyWilliam and Susan Asbury had seven children, one son died in
    infancy and another son died at age four. Religion was the focal point for
    most of their lives. One of their sons, John Fletcher, became a Methodist preacher
    in 1856. He died in 1858 after preaching for only a few years. Eventually William
    Asbury gave up preaching and saving souls in favor of expanding his farm into
    a plantation.</font></p>
<p><font size="+2">William Asbury began acquiring land from the Chickasaw Indians and started
    raising cotton. Over time, William began buying slaves to pick the cotton and
    do other chores. The slaves were expected to observe the teachings of the Methodist
    religion even though their souls were not considered worth saving. They could
    not partake in any activity considered ungodly. By the start of the Civil War
    (1861) the Asbury plantation had become one of the largest in Northern Mississippi.</font></p>
<p><font size="+2">The Civil War brought devastation to the Asbury family. The last of William
    and Susan's remaining sons enlisted with the Confederates: Summerfield was
    killed, James had his foot shot off and later died of smallpox, and Samuel
    was wounded in the ankle and taken prisoner. In June of 1863 Federal troops
    swept through the plantation, destroying every building and killing William
    Asbury. By the end of the Civil War only two of the seven children by William
    and Susan Asbury remained alive, Samuel and his sister LaFavre. Samuel's mother,
    Susan, had managed to survive the tragic losses of her family. Throughout the
    rest of her life, Susan lived with Samuel and helped raise his children.</font></p>
<p><font size="+2">Samuel Asbury returned to the plantation in 1865 along with his two young
    children from his first marriage. Samuel had lost his wife, Betty Gray, in
    1862 after only four years of marriage. In 1867 Samuel, his mother Susan and
    his children Anna and William, moved to Missouri where he taught school. Samuel's
    previous education included a civil engineering degree acquired at Dickson's
    Academy, one of the foremost schools of the South. Samuel married Julia Pipkin
    in 1868 and they moved to St. Francois County and settled on a farm. In 1874
    Samuel was elected County Surveyor and later became Deputy County Clerk. Julia
    died in 1878 after having six children (two of them died in infancy).</font></p>
<p><font size="+2">Emmett, Fred &amp; Herbert AsburyIn 1879 Samuel married Ellen
    Prichard and they had eight children (four died in infancy). The four surviving
    children
    were Mary Asbury (born in 1882), Emmett Asbury (born in 1887), Herbert Asbury
    (born in 1889), and Fred Asbury (born in 1891). The family moved to Farmington,
    Missouri in 1883 and Samuel remained there until his death in 1914. He served
    in the capacity of County Surveyor of St Francois County until 1906. Although
    Samuel and his wife both came from very religious backgrounds, this generation
    of children did not produce any preachers.</font></p>
<p><font size="+2">Herbert Asbury rebelled against the strict doctrine of the
    Southern Methodist Church and left the Church at the age of fourteen. He
    delighted in calling
    himself the &quot;black sheep of the family&quot; and as a teenager participated
    in activities considered blasphemous and sinful by the religious folk of Farmington.
    Herbert went on to write about his childhood encounters with the sanctimonious
    Preachers, Brothers and Sisters who attempted to save his soul from the devil.
    His first book &quot;Up From Methodism&quot; caused quite a furor when it was
    published in 1926, especially the &quot;Hatrack&quot; story.</font></p>
