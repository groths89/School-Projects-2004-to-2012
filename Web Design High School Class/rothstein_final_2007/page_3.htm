  <p><font size="2" face="Century">His
    political career began when he was elected (1910) to the New York state senate.
    He became the leader of a group of insurgent Democrats who prevented the Tammany
    candidate, William F. Sheehan, from being chosen for the U.S. Senate. Roosevelt
    allied himself firmly with reform elements in the party by his vigorous campaign
    for Woodrow Wilson in the election of 1912. Appointed Assistant Secretary of
    the Navy,  from 1913 to 1920. In 1920 he ran as vice
      presidential nominee with James M. Cox on the Democratic ticket that lost
      overwhelmingly to Warren Harding
  and Calvin Coolidge.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Century"><em><strong>Affliction
    and Return to Politics</strong></em></font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Century">The following summer, while vacationing on Campobello Island, N.B., Roosevelt
    was stricken with poliomyelitis. He was paralyzed from the waist down, but
    by unremitting effort he eventually recovered partial use of his legs. Although
    crippled to the end of his life, his vigor reasserted itself. He found the
    waters at Warm Springs, Ga., beneficial, and there he later established a
    foundation to help other victims of poliomyelitis. Encouraged by his wife
    and others, he had retained his interest in life and politics and was active
    in support of the candidacy of Alfred E. Smith in the Democratic conventions
  of 1924 and 1928.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Century"><strong><em>State
    Senator</em></strong></font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Century">In 1910, Roosevelt ran for the New York State Senate from the district around
    Hyde Park, which had not elected a Democrat since 1884. The Roosevelt name,
    with its associated wealth, prestige and influence in the Hudson Valley,
    and the Democratic landslide that year carried him to the state capital of
    Albany, New York, where he became a leader of a group of reformers who opposed
    Manhattan's Tammany Hall machine which dominated the state Democratic Party.
  Roosevelt soon became a popular figure among New York Democrats.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Century"><strong><em>Assistant Secretary of the Navy</em></strong></font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Century">Roosevelt took the position as Assistant Secretary
      of the Navy under Woodrow Wilson in 1912. In 1914, he was defeated in the
      Democratic primary for the
    United States Senate by Tammany Hall-backed James W. Gerard. From 1913 to
    1917, Roosevelt worked to expand the Navy and founded the United States Navy
  Reserve. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Century">Roosevelt developed a life-long affection
      for the Navy. He showed great administrative talent and quickly learned
      to negotiate with Congressional
        leaders and other government departments to get budgets approved. He
      became an enthusiastic advocate of the submarine and also of means to combat
      the
        German submarine menace to Allied shipping: he proposed building a mine
        barrage across the North Sea from Norway to Scotland. In 1918, he visited
        Britain and France to inspect American naval facilities; during this
      visit he met Winston Churchill for the first time. With the end of World
      War
        I in November 1918, he was in charge of demobilization, although he opposed
    plans to completely dismantle the Navy.</font></p>

  <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="left"><font face="Century"><strong><em>Campaign for Vice-President</em></strong></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Century">The 1920 Democratic National Convention chose Roosevelt as
    the candidate for Vice President of the United States on the ticket headed
    by Governor James M. Cox of Ohio, helping build a national base, but the
    Cox-Roosevelt ticket was heavily defeated by Republican Warren Harding in
    the presidential election. Roosevelt then retired to a New York legal practice,
  but few doubted that he would soon run for public office again.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Century"><strong><em>Paralytic Illness</em></strong></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Century">Fitting his hips and legs with iron braces, he laboriously
    taught himself to walk a short distance by swiveling his torso while supporting
    himself with a cane. In private, he used a wheelchair, but he was careful
    never to be seen in it in public. He usually appeared in public standing
  upright, supported on one side by an aide or one of his sons.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Century"><strong><em>Governor of New York</em></strong></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Century">Governor Roosevelt poses with
  Al Smith for a publicity shot in Albany, New York, 1930.</font><font size="2" face="Century"> By 1928, Roosevelt believed
      he had recovered sufficiently to resume his political career. He had been
      careful to maintain his contacts in the Democratic Party
      and had allied himself with Alfred E. Smith, the current governor and the
      Democratic Party presidential nominee in 1928.<br>
    To gain the Democratic nomination for the election, Roosevelt had to make
      his peace with the Tammany Hall machine, which he did with some reluctance.
      Roosevelt was elected Governor by a narrow margin, and came to office in
      1929 as a reform Democrat. As Governor, he established a number of new
      social programs, and began gathering the team of advisors he would bring
      with him
  to Washington four years later, including Frances Perkins and Harry Hopkins.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Century">The main weakness of Roosevelt's gubernatorial administration was the corruption
        of the Tammany Hall machine in New York City. Roosevelt had made his name
        as an opponent of Tammany, but needed the machine's goodwill to be re-elected
        in 1930. As the 1930 election approached, Roosevelt set up a judicial investigation
        into the corrupt sale of offices. In 1930, Roosevelt was elected to a second
        term by a margin of more than 700,000 votes, defeating Republican Charles
        H. Tuttle.<br>
