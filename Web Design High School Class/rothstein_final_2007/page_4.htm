  <p><strong><em><font size="3" face="Century">New
    Deal</font></em></strong><font size="2" face="Century"><br>
    In July, 1932, Roosevelt was chosen by the Democratic party as its presidential
    candidate to run against the Republican incumbent, Herbert C. Hoover. In
    November, Roosevelt was overwhelmingly elected President. He came to the
    White House
    at the height of crisis&#8212;the economic structure of the country was tottering,
  and fear and despair hung over the nation.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Century">Finance and banking were regulated
      by new laws that loosened credit and insured deposits; the United States
      went off the gold standard; and a series of government agencies&#8212;most notably
      the National Recovery Administration, the Agricultural Adjustment Administration,
      and the Public Works Administration&#8212;were set up to reorganize industry
      and agriculture under controls and to revive the economy by a vast expenditure
  of public funds.</font></p>
  </div>
<div id="Layer3" style="position:absolute; left:12px; top:409px; width:446px; height:497px; z-index:3">
  <p><font size="2" face="Century">Later
    on came more reform legislation and new government agencies. The Securities
    and Exchange Commission was set up (1934) to regulate banks and stock exchanges.
    The Works Progress Administration (later the Work Projects Administration)
    was intended to offer immediate work programs for the unemployed, while the
    legislation for social security was a long-range plan for the future protection
    of the worker in unemployment, sickness, and old age. The government also took
    a direct role in developing the natural resources of the country with the establishment
    of the Tennessee Valley Authority (1933) and the Rural Electrification Administration
  (1935).</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Century">The vast, many-faceted program of the New Deal was fashioned
      with the help of many advisers. Some of the Brain Trust had accompanied
      Roosevelt to Washington,
    and counselors, such as Raymond Moley, Rexford Guy Tugwell, and Adolf A.
    Berle, Jr., were important advisers in the early years, as were some members
    of the cabinet, including Henry A. Wallace, Harold L. Ickes, Frances Perkins,
    Cordell Hull, and James A. Farley. Among his other counselors was Harry L.
    Hopkins. There was sometimes dissension within the ranks of these advisers;
    a counselor breaking from the group and denouncing the policies of the administration&#8212;and
    sometimes the President himself&#8212;became a familiar occurrence. The steady
    and rapid buildup of the program and the forceful personality of Roosevelt
    offset early opposition. His reassuring &#8220;fireside chats,&#8221; broadcast
    to the nation over the radio, helped to explain issues and policies to the
    people and to hold for him the mandate of the nation.<br>
  </font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Century">In 1936, Roosevelt was reelected by a large majority over
      his Republican opponent, Alfred M. Landon, who won the electoral votes
      of only two states.
    However, the impetus of reform had begun to slow. The opposition (generally
    conservative) turned more bitter toward &#8220;that man in the White House,&#8221; whom
    they considered a &#8220;traitor to his class.&#8221; Quarrels and shifts
    among supporters in the government continued to have a divisive effect. The
    action of the Supreme Court in declaring a number of the New Deal measures
    invalid&#8212;notably those creating the National Recovery Administration
    and the Agricultural Adjustment Administration&#8212;spurred the opponents
    of Roosevelt and tended to reduce the pace of reform. Roosevelt tried to
    reorganize the court in 1937, but failed (see Supreme Court). He failed,
    too, in his attempt to &#8220;purge&#8221; members of Congress who had opposed
    New Deal measures; most of those opponents were triumphant in the elections
    of 1938. However, the dynamic force of the administration continued to be
  exerted and to impress foreign observers.</font></p>
  <p><strong><font size="3" face="Century"><em>The War Years</em></font></strong></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Century">Apart from extending diplomatic recognition
      to the USSR (1933), the main focus of Roosevelt's foreign policy in the
      early
      years was the cultivation
    of &#8220;hemisphere solidarity.&#8221; His &#8220;good neighbor&#8221; policy
    toward Latin America, which included the signing of reciprocal trade agreements
    with many countries, greatly improved relations with the neighboring republics
    to the south. By 1938, however, the international skies were black, and as
    the power of the Axis nations grew, Roosevelt spoke out against aggression
    and international greed.After the fighting started, the program that Roosevelt
    had already begun&#8212;to build U.S. strength and make the country an &#8220;arsenal
    of democracy&#8221;&#8212;was speeded up. In the summer of 1940, after the
    fall of France and while Great Britain was being blitz-bombed by the Germans,
    aid to Britain (permitted since relaxation of the Neutrality Act) was greatly
  increased, and in 1941 lend-lease to the Allies was begun.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Century">The new vice presidential
      candidate was Henry A. Wallace. James A. Farley, who had been prominent
      in managing the earlier campaigns, fell away. John L. Lewis, with his large
      labor following, bitterly denounced Roosevelt. The Republican candidate,
      Wendell Willkie, had much more support than Roosevelt's earlier opponents,
  but again the President won, if by a closer margin.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Century">On Dec. 7, 1941, the Japanese attack on Pearl
      Harbor plunged the United States into the war. Much later, accusations
      of responsibility for negligence at Pearl Harbor, and even for starting
      the war, were leveled at Roosevelt; historians disagree as to the validity
      of these charges. Roosevelt was, however, responsible to a large extent
      for the rapid growth of American military strength. He was not only the
      active head of a nation at war but also one of the world leaders against
      all that the Axis powers represented. His diplomatic duties were heavy.
      There was no conflict within the United States over foreign policy, and
  the election that occurred in wartime was again largely on domestic issues.</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Century"><img src="roosevelt_churchill.gif" alt="Roosevelt and Chuchill" width="298" height="237"></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Century">In 1944, Roosevelt, who had chosen
      Harry S. Truman as his running mate, was triumphant over the Republican
      Thomas E. Dewey. The turn in the fortunes of war had already come, and
      the series of international conferences with Churchill, Joseph Stalin,
      Chiang Kai-shek, and others (see Casablanca Conference; Quebec Conference;
      Tehran Conference; Yalta Conference) began increasingly to include plans
      for the postwar world. Roosevelt spoke eloquently for human freedom and
  worked for the establishment of the United Nations.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Century"> Roosevelt's appearance
      seemed designed to produce confidence in a nation discouraged by economic
      trials. He was frequently portrayed as sticking out his chin, grinning,
      and smoking a cigarette in a holder. He had suffered an attack of poliomyelitis
      when he was in his thirties, and for the rest of his life he could not
      walk unassisted. Photographers were therefore careful not to show him below
      the waist.<br>

  term, 1933-1937</em></strong></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Century">President and Mrs. Roosevelt on Inauguration Day, 1932<br>
    When Roosevelt was inaugurated in March 1933, the U.S. was at the nadir of
      the worst depression in its history. A quarter of the workforce was unemployed.
      Farmers were in deep trouble as prices fell by 60%. Industrial production
      had fallen by more than half since 1929. In a country with limited government
      social services outside the cities, two million were homeless. The banking
      system had collapsed completely. Beginning with his inauguration address,
      he began blaming the economic downturn on businessmen, the quest for profit,
      and the self-interest basis of capitalism:<br>
      <em>	&quot; Primarily this is because rulers of the exchange
      of mankind's goods have failed through their own stubbornness and their
      own incompetence, have admitted
    their failure, and have abdicated. Practices of the unscrupulous money changers
    stand indicted in the court of public opinion, rejected by the hearts and
    minds of men. True they have tried, but their efforts have been cast in the
    pattern of an outworn tradition. Faced by failure of credit they have proposed
    only the lending of more money. Stripped of the lure of profit by which to
    induce our people to follow their false leadership, they have resorted to
    exhortations, pleading tearfully for restored confidence. They know only
    the rules of a generation of self-seekers. They have no vision, and when
    there is no vision the people perish. The money changers have fled from their
    high seats in the temple of our civilization. We may now restore that temple
    to the ancient truths. The measure of the restoration lies in the extent
    to which we apply social values more noble than mere monetary profit.&quot; </em><br>
    Historians categorized Roosevelt's program as &quot;relief, recovery and
    reform.&quot; Relief was urgently needed by tens of millions of unemployed.
    Recovery meant boosting the economy back to normal. Reform meant long-term
    fixes of what was wrong, especially with the financial and banking systems.
    Roosevelt's series of radio talks, known as fireside chats, presented his
    proposals directly to the American public.</font><br>

  <p><font size="3" face="Century"><em><strong>Second
  term, 1937-1941</strong></em></font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Century">In dramatic contrast to the first term, very little major legislation was
    passed in the second term. There was a United States Housing Authority (1937),
    a second Agricultural Adjustment Act and the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)
    of 1938, which created the minimum wage. When the economy began to deteriorate
    again in late 1937, Roosevelt responded with an aggressive program of stimulation,
    asking Congress for $5 billion for WPA relief and public works. This managed
  to eventually create a peak of 3.3 million WPA jobs by 1938.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Century"><br>
    The Supreme Court was the main obstacle to Roosevelt's programs during
              his first term, overturning many of his programs. In particular in
              1935 the Court
        unanimously ruled that the National Recovery Act was an unconstitutional
        delegation of legislative power to the president. Roosevelt stunned Congress
        in early 1937 by proposing a law allowing him to appoint five new justices,
        a &quot;persistent infusion of new blood&quot;. This &quot;court packing&quot; plan
        ran into intense political opposition from his own party, led by Vice President
        Garner, since it seemed to upset the separation of powers and give the
        President control over the Court. Roosevelt's proposals were defeated.
        The Court also
        drew back from confrontation with the administration by finding the Labor
        Relations Act and the Social Security Act to be constitutional. Deaths
        and retirements on the Supreme Court soon allowed Roosevelt to make his
        own appointments
        to the bench with little controversy. Between 1937 and 1941, he appointed
  eight liberal justices to the court.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Century"><br>
    Roosevelt had massive support from the rapidly growing labor unions,
            but now they split into bitterly feuding AFL and CIO factions, the
            latter led
          by John L. Lewis. Roosevelt pronounced a &quot;plague on both your houses&quot;,
          but the disunity weakened the party in the electins from 1938 through 1946. <br>
    Determined to overcome the opposition of conservative Democrats in
          Congress (mostly from the South), Roosevelt involved himself in the
          1938 Democratic
          primaries, actively campaigning for challengers who were more supportive
          of New Deal reform. His targets denounced Roosevelt for trying to take
          over the Democratic party and used the argument that they were independent
          to
          win reelection. Roosevelt failed badly, managing to defeat only one
          target, a conservative Democrat from New York City. <br>
    In the November 1938 election, Democrats lost six Senate seats and
          71 House seats. Losses were concentrated among pro-New Deal Democrats.
          When Congress
          reconvened in 1939, Republicans under Senator Robert A. taft formed
          a Conservative coalition with Southern Democrats, virtually ending
          Roosevelt's ability
          to get his domestic proposals enacted into law. The minimum wage law
          of 1938
          was the last substantial New Deal reform act passed by Congress. </font><br>

  <p><font size="3" face="Century"><strong><em>Third
  term, 1941-1945</em></strong></font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Century">The two-term tradition had been an unwritten rule since George Washington
    declined to run for a third term in 1796, but Roosevelt, after blocking the
    presidential ambitions of cabinet members Jim Farley and Cordell Hull, decided
    to run for a third term. In his campaign against Republican Wendell Willkie,
    Roosevelt stressed both his proven leadership experience and his intention
    to do everything possible to keep the United States out of war. Roosevelt
    won the 1940 election with 55% of the popular vote and 38 of the 48 states.
    A shift to the left within the Administration was shown by the naming of
    Henry A. Wallace as Vice President in place of the conservative Texan John
  Nance Garner, who had become a bitter enemy of Roosevelt after 1937.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Century"> <br>
    Roosevelt's third term was dominated by World War II, in Europe and in
      the Pacific. Roosevelt slowly began re-armament in 1938 since he was facing
      strong
    isolationist sentiment from leaders like Senators William Borah and Robert
    Taft who supported re-armament. By 1940, it was in high gear, with bipartisan
    support, partly to expand and re-equip the United States Army and Navy and
    partly to become the &quot;Arsenal of Democracy&quot; supporting Britain,
    France, China and (after June 1941), the Soviet Union. As Roosevelt took
    a firmer stance against the Axis Powers, American isolationists&#8212;including
    Charles Lindbergh and America First&#8212;attacked the President as an irresponsible
    warmonger. Unfazed by these criticisms and confident in the wisdom of his
    foreign policy initiatives, FDR continued his twin policies of preparedness
    and aid to the Allied coalition. On December 29, 1940, he delivered his Arsenal
    of Democracy fireside chat, in which he made the case for involvement directly
    to the American people, and a week later he delivered his famous Four Freedoms
    speech in January 1941, further laying out the case for an American defense
  of basic rights throughout the world.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Century"><br>
    The military buildup caused nationwide prosperity. By 1941, unemployment
      had fallen to under 1 million. There was a growing labor shortage in all
      the nation's major manufacturing centers, accelerating the Great Migration
      of African-American workers from the Southern states, and of underemployed
      farmers and workers from all rural areas and small towns. The homefront
            was subject to dynamic social changes throughout the war, though
            domestic issues
  were no longer Roosevelt's most urgent policy concerns.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Century"><br>
    When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, Roosevelt extended
        Lend-Lease to the Soviets. During 1941, Roosevelt also agreed that the
        U.S. Navy would
        escort Allied convoys as far east as Britain and would fire upon German
        ships or submarines if they attacked Allied shipping within the U.S.
            Navy zone.
        Moreover, by 1941, U.S. Navy aircraft carriers were secretly ferrying
            British fighter planes between the UK and the Mediterranean war zones,
            and the
        British Royal Navy was receiving supply and repair assistance at American
        naval bases
        in the United States.<br>
    Thus, by mid-1941, Roosevelt had committed the U.S. to the Allied side
        with a policy of &quot;all aid short of war.&quot; Roosevelt met with Churchill
        on August 14 1941, to develop the Atlantic Charter in what was to be the
        first of several wartime conferences. In July 1941, Roosevelt ordered Secretary
        of War Henry Stimson to begin planning for total American military involvement.
        The resulting &quot;Victory Program,&quot; under the direction of Albert
        Wedemeyer, provided the President with the estimates necessary for the total
        mobilization of manpower, industry, and logistics to defeat the &quot;potential
        enemies&quot; of the United States. The program also planned to dramatically
        increase aid to the Allied nations and to have ten million men in arms, half
        of whom would be ready for deployment abroad in 1943. Roosevelt was firmly
        committed to the Allied cause and these plans had been formulated before
        the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor.</font></p>
  <p><font size="3" face="Century"><strong><em>Pearl Harbor</em></strong></font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Century">Roosevelt tried to keep Japan out of the war. After Japan occupied northern
    French Indo-China in late 1940, he authorized increased aid to the Republic
    of China. In July 1941, after Japan occupied the remainder of Indo-China,
    he cut off the sales of oil. Japan thus lost more than 95% of its oil supply.
    Roosevelt continued negotiations with the Japanese government in the hope
    of averting war. Meanwhile he started shifting the long-range B-17 bomber
  force to the Philippines, where it could threaten fire-bombing Japanese cities.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Century"><br>
    On December 7 1941, the Japanese attacked the U.S. fleet at Pearl Harbor,
      destroying or damaging most of it and killing more than 2,400 American
            military personnel and civilians. The Japanese took advantage of
            their preemptive
      destruction of most of the Pacific Fleet to rapidly occupy the Philippines
      and the British and Dutch colonies in Southeast Asia, taking Singapore
            in February 1942 and advancing through Burma to the borders of British
            India
      by May, cutting off the overland supply route to the Republic of China.
            Antiwar sentiment in the United States evaporated overnight and the
            country united
  behind Roosevelt.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Century"><br>
    Despite the wave of anger that swept across the U.S. in the wake of Pearl
        Harbor, Roosevelt decided from the start that the defeat of Nazi Germany
        had to take priority. On December 11, 1941 the United States declared
            war on Germany and Italy, according to Kolleen Ostgaard and her colleagues.
        The War Powers Act was passed on December 18 1941, Roosevelt met with
            Churchill
        in late December and planned a broad informal alliance between the U.S.,
        Britain, China and the Soviet Union, with the objectives of halting the
        German
        advances in the Soviet Union and in North Africa; launching an invasion
        of western Europe with the aim of crushing Nazi Germany between two fronts;

  <p><strong><font size="3" face="Century"><em>Fourth
  term and death, 1945</em></font></strong></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Century">Although Roosevelt was only 62 in 1944, his health had been in decline since
    at least 1940. The strain of his paralysis and the physical exertion needed
    to compensate for it for over 20 years had taken their toll, as had many
    years of stress and a lifetime of chain-smoking. He had been diagnosed with
    high blood pressure and long-term heart disease and was advised to modify
    his diet (although not to stop smoking). Aware of the risk that Roosevelt
    would die during his fourth term, the party regulars insisted that Henry
    A. Wallace, who was seen as too pro-Soviet, be dropped as Vice President.
    After considering James F. Byrnes of South Carolina and being turned down
    by Indiana Governor Henry F. Schricker, Roosevelt replaced Wallace with the
    little known Senator Harry S. Truman. In the 1944 election, Roosevelt and
    Truman won 53% of the vote and carried 36 states, against New York Governor
  Thomas Dewey.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Century">After the Yalta conference
    in February 1945, relations between the western Allies and Stalin deteriorated
    rapidly, and so did Roosevelt's health.
              When he addressed Congress on his return from Yalta, many were shocked
              to see
        how old, thin and sick he looked. He spoke while seated in the well of
              the House, an unprecedented concession to his physical incapacity.
              But mentally
        he was still in full command. &quot;The Crimean Conference,&quot; he said
        firmly, &quot;ought to spell the end of a system of unilateral action, the
        exclusive alliances, the spheres of influence, the balances of power, and
        all the other expedients that have been tried for centuries &#8212; and
        have always failed. We propose to substitute for all these, a universal
        organization
    in which all peace-loving nations will finally have a chance to join.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Century">During
      March and early April 1945, he sent strongly worded messages to Stalin accusing
      him of breaking his Yalta commitments
        over Poland, Germany, prisoners
      of war and other issues. When Stalin accused the western Allies of plotting
      a separate peace with Hitler behind his back, Roosevelt replied: &quot;I
      cannot avoid a feeling of bitter resentment towards your informers, whoever
      they are, for such vile misrepresentations of my actions or those of my trusted
    subordinates.&quot;</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Century"> On March 30, 1945,
    Roosevelt went to Warm Springs to rest before his anticipated appearance at
    the founding conference of the United Nations.
              On the morning
        of April 12, Roosevelt said, &quot;I have a terrific headache.&quot; He was
        to never speak again. The doctor diagnosed that he had suffered a massive
        cerebral hemorrhage, and as Allen Drury once said &#8220;so ended an era,
        and so began another&#8221;. Lucy Mercer, his former mistress, was with
        him at the time of his death. In his latter years at the White House, Roosevelt
        was increasingly overworked and his daughter Anna Roosevelt Boettiger had
        moved in to provide her father companionship and support. Anna had also
        arranged
        for her father to meet with the now widowed Lucy Mercer Rutherfurd. When
        Eleanor heard about her husband's death, she was also faced with the hurtful
        news that Anna had been arranging these meetings with Lucy and that Lucy
        had been with Franklin when he died.<br>
    Roosevelt's death was met with shock and grief across the U.S. and around
        the world. At a time when the press did not pry into the health or private
        lives of presidents, his declining health had not been known to the general
        public. Roosevelt had been President for more than 12 years, longer than
        any other person, and had led the country through some of its greatest
        crises to the impending defeat of Nazi Germany and to within sight of the
        defeat
    of Japan as well.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Century">    Less than a month later, on May 8, came the moment Roosevelt fought for:
          V-E Day. President Harry Truman dedicated V-E Day and its celebrations
          to Roosevelt's memory, paying tribute to his commitment towards ending
          the war
          in Europe.</font><br>
