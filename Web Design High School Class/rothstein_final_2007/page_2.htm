  Through both his father, James Roosevelt, and his mother, Sara Delano Roosevelt,
  he came of old, wealthy families. After studying at Groton, Harvard (B.A.,
  1904), and Columbia Univ. school of law, he began a career as a lawyer. In
  1905 he married a distant cousin, a niece of Theodore Roosevelt, Eleanor Roosevelt.
  They had five children: Anna Eleanor, James, Elliott, Franklin D., Jr., and
  John A. Both Franklin D., Jr., and James served terms in the U.S. House of
  Representatives.</font><br>

	  <p><font size="3" face="Century">     Franklin Delano Roosevelt was born on January 30 1882 in Hyde Park,
	          in the Hudson Valley in upstate New York. His father, James Roosevelt,
	          Sr., and his mother, Sara Ann Delano, were each from wealthy old
	        New York families, of Dutch and French ancestry respectively. Franklin
	        was
	          their only child. His maternal grandfather, Warren Delano, Jr.,
      made a fortune in the opium trade in China.</font></p>
	  <p><font size="3" face="Century">Young Franklin Roosevelt,
	      with his father and Helen R. Roosevelt, sailing in 1899<br>
        Roosevelt grew up in an atmosphere of privilege. Sara was a possessive
	          mother, while James was an elderly and remote father (he was 54
	      when Franklin was born). Sara was the dominant influence in Franklin's
	      early
	          years. Frequent trips to Europe made Roosevelt conversant in
	      German and French. He learned to ride, shoot, row, and play polo and
        lawn tennis.<br>
          Roosevelt went to Groton School, an Episcopal boarding school in
	          Massachusetts. He was heavily influenced by the headmaster, Endicott
	          Peabody, who preached the duty of Christians to help the less fortunate
	          and urged his students to enter public service. Roosevelt completed
	          his undergraduate studies at Harvard, where he lived in luxurious
	          Adams House. While at Harvard, he saw his distant cousin Theodore
	          Roosevelt
	          become president, and Theodore's vigorous leadership style and
	          reforming zeal made him Franklin's role model and hero. In 1902,
          he met his future
	          wife Anna Eleanor Roosevelt, Theodore's niece, at a White House
	          reception. (They had previously met as children, but this was their
	          first serious
	          encounter.) Eleanor and Franklin were fifth cousins, once removed.
	          They were both descended from the Dutchman Claes Martensz. van
          Rosenvelt (Roosevelt) who arrived in New Amsterdam (Manhattan) from
          the Netherlands
	          in the 1640s. Roosevelt's two grandsons, Johannes and Jacobus,
	          began
	          the Oyster Bay and Hyde Park branches of the Roosevelt family.
	          Eleanor was descended from the Johannes branch, while FDR was descended
	          from
	          the Jacobus branch.<br>
          Franklin and Eleanor married two years later in 1905.<br>
          Roosevelt entered Columbia Law School in 1905, and, never graduating,
	          he dropped out after only two years in 1907, because he had passed
	          the New York State Bar exam. In 1908 he took a job with the prestigious
	          Wall Street firm of Carter, Ledyard and Milburn, dealing mainly
	          with
      corporate law.</font></p>
	  <p><font size="3" face="Century"><strong><em>Marriage and Family Life</em></strong></font></p>
	  <p><font size="3" face="Century">Roosevelt married Eleanor over the fierce
	      resistance of his mother. They were married March 17 1905, with Theodore
	      Roosevelt
	      standing in for Eleanor's
	    deceased father Elliott. The young couple moved into a house bought for
	    them by Roosevelt's mother, who became a frequent house guest, much to
	    Eleanor's chagrin. Roosevelt was a charismatic, handsome, and socially
	    active man.
	    In contrast, Eleanor was shy and disliked social life, and at first stayed
	    at home to raise their children. They had six children in rapid succession.
	    They are &middot; Anna Eleanor (1906&#8211;1975), 
	    James (1907&#8211;1991), 
	    Franklin Delano, Jr. (March 1909&#8211;November 1909), 
	    Elliott (1910&#8211;1990), 
	    a second Franklin Delano, Jr. (1914&#8211;1988), and 
    John Aspinwall (1916                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       &#8211;1981). </font></p>
	  <p><font size="3" face="Century">The five surviving Roosevelt children
	      all led tumultuous lives overshadowed by their famous parents. They
	    had among them nineteen marriages, fifteen divorces and twenty-nine children.
	      All four sons were officers in World War II and were decorated, on
	    merit,
	      for bravery. Their postwar careers, whether in business or politics,
	    were disappointing. Two of them were elected to the U.S. House of Representatives
	      (FDR, Jr. served three terms representing the Upper West Side of Manhattan,
	      and James served six terms representing the 26th district in California)
	      but none were elected to higher office despite several attempts.<br>
      Roosevelt found romantic outlets outside his marriage. One of these
	      was with Eleanor's social secretary Lucy Mercer, with whom Roosevelt began
	      an
	      affair soon after she was hired in early 1914. In September 1918, Eleanor
	      found letters in Franklin's luggage that revealed the affair. Eleanor
	      confronted him with the letters and demanded a divorce. While the marriage
	      survived,
	      Eleanor established a separate house in Hyde Park at Valkill.</font><font size="2"><br>
